Expenses Tracking Application

name: Ruijin Zhang
semester: 2023 Spring

  From this project, what i have learned is how to organize our code efficiently, i can divide our code into so many function or methods in order to fix it really quickly when i find some bugs, instead of a single giant main function. when i was writing code, the first thing was to write the doc string comment for every functions. one is to make others readable, on the other hand is make me know exactly what i want the function to do and return. and also, i gradually name the function or methods descriptive. just make it understandable.
  
  As i said, i really like the way i did on how dividing our entire code into pieces of smaller one. whenever i got some kind of errors, i just need to find out the specific function and fix it, which would not affect the other code function.
  
  When i was writing this program, i found that maybe there will be a few feature i can do in the future like time management, i need to figure out how the category files can vary depending on the time change. Because this is a monthly expenses tracking application, we need to update a new expenses when time goes into next month. financial advices, maybe we can ask the user type their income and financial purpose, based that information, we can give them some financial advices. help users to set budgets for specific categories and track their progress towards their goals. Send users reminders or notifications when they approach their budget limits or when they have not logged expenses in a while.
  
  Speaking to what struggling with the most, i would say validate the user input and handle the all kinds of error. i need to make sure that the user would type in the valid type of data structure, otherwise printing the specific error message.
  
  Programming logic: This project requires me to think logically and create a program that can handle user inputs, store data, and provide outputs based on certain conditions. Developing such skills can help me become a better programmer and solve problems efficiently. File handling: This project involves reading and writing to CSV files, which are commonly used in data storage and processing. Understanding how to handle files is an important skill that can be applied to other programming projects. Project management: This project requires me to break down the problem into manageable parts and create a plan to complete each part. Developing project management skills can help me manage large projects and work collaboratively with other programmers. Overall, this expenses tracking application can help me develop a range of skills that are essential in achieving my future goals as a programmer.
